    <h2 style="color: #333;">Problem</h2>
    <p style="color: #333;">React 19's change in how siblings of suspended components are prerendered can lead to performance degradation. This is because it changes a parallel rendering pattern to a waterfall pattern, causing requests to be made sequentially instead of concurrently. This can significantly impact application loading times, especially when dealing with slow network conditions.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #333;">Reason</h2>
    <p style="color: #333;">The change in React 19 is aimed at improving how Suspense handles asynchronous tasks, but it inadvertently affects the default behavior of prerendering. The new behavior makes it so that siblings of suspended components are not prerendered, leading to the waterfall pattern and performance issues. </p>
    <h2 style="color: #333;">Possible Fixes</h2>
    <ul style="color: #333;">
        <li><b>Opt-in/Opt-out Mechanism:</b> Introduce a configurable option (e.g., <code>strategy={"parallel" | "sequential"}</code>) to control the behavior of prerendering with suspended components. This would allow developers to choose the approach that best suits their application's needs.</li>
        <li><b>Boundary-Level Configuration:</b> Allow developers to specify the prerendering strategy on a boundary level. This would enable fine-grained control over the behavior of Suspense within specific parts of the application.</li>
        <li><b>"Wait for Pending" Algorithm:</b> This alternative algorithm could potentially resolve all thrown promises before re-rendering, improving performance for flat asynchronous trees. However, it might introduce slower initial rendering for nested asynchronous components.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color: #333;">While the issue is still under active development, the React team is aware of the problem and is working on a solution. They are considering various options and have started implementing some changes to address the issue. </p>
